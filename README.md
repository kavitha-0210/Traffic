# Traffic Data Analysis & Anomaly Detection

This project focuses on analyzing traffic dataset values such as vehicle count and traffic violations, and identifying abnormal patterns using statistical methods like Z-Score anomaly detection. The goal is to detect unusual spikes, drops, or irregular behavior in traffic flow.

 Project Features
 Data Preprocessing

Load dataset (CSV/Excel).

Automatically detect numeric columns.

Handle non-numeric categorical values such as “No Helmet”, “Using Mobile Phone”, “Over-speeding”, etc.

Clean missing or inconsistent values.

 Statistical Analysis

Computation of average vehicle count.

Identification of peak traffic hours.

Generation of z-scores to detect abnormal readings.

 Anomaly Detection

Using Z-score:

A value is considered an anomaly if:

∣
𝑍
∣
>
2
∣Z∣>2

Detects unusual traffic spikes or suspiciously low values.

 Output

Prints peak traffic hour with vehicle count

Displays all anomaly rows

Saves analysis results (optional) 

Technologies Used

Python 3

Pandas

NumPy (optional)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

 Dataset Requirements

Your dataset should include:

At least one numeric column (e.g., Vehicle Count)

Optional categorical column for traffic violations

No merged/combined string fields for numeric data


 Use Cases

Traffic monitoring systems

Smart city analytics

Violation detection

Predictive congestion analysis
